# HighViolet

A small side project I got the involves hexagons

For now there's not much to see...
But here's how to install it

```bash
git clone git@github.com:April-Gras/HighViolet.git
cd HighViolet
chmod +x ./install.debian.sh
./install.debian.sh
```

## Keybinds

ASDW -> Move
Escape -> leave the program
